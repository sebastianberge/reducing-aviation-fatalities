# Reducing Commercial Aviation Fatalities

Machine-learning project for reducing commercial aviation fatalities.

## Information

This was a former Kaggle Competition. For learning purposes and fun, I made a go on it as well.

The train- and testdata, including the sample-submisson file are all dowloaded from the Kaggle Competition.

## How to use

Git clone the project, open the terminal on your selected computer. Enter the cloned folder and write jupyter notebook. (Depends if you have python and jupyter installed)
